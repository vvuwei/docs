TERMS</h1><p>Last Revised on 1/16/2023</p><p>Welcome to the Supplemental Terms (these <strong>&quot;ITN Award Program Terms&quot;</strong> or <strong>&quot;Terms&quot;</strong>)
for the Incentivized Testnet Award Program
(the <strong>&quot;ITN Award Program&quot;</strong> or the <strong>&quot;Program&quot;</strong>) as operated on behalf of Strange
Loop Labs AG (<strong>&quot;Company&quot;</strong>, <strong>&quot;we&quot;</strong> or <strong>&quot;us&quot;</strong>). The ITN Award Program provides eligible
users of a Testnet designated by the Company the opportunity to earn rewards,
which may include Celestia tokens. These Terms are supplemental to, and
incorporate by reference, the broader Celestia Terms of Service
(<strong>&quot;Services Terms&quot;</strong>) available at <a href="https://celestia.org/tos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celestia Terms of Service</a>.</p><p>Defined terms used but not defined herein have the meaning set forth in the
Services Terms. The Program and your participation in it is a Service as
defined under the Services Terms.</p><p>These Terms govern your ability to participate in the Program and any awards
you receive from that participation, which may include Celestia tokens (<strong>&quot;ITN Rewards&quot;</strong>).</p><p>Please read these Terms carefully, as they include important information about
your legal rights. By participating in the Program or claiming ITN Rewards,
you are agreeing to these Terms. If you do not understand or agree to these
Terms, please do not participate in the Program or claim ITN Rewards.</p><p>In order to participate in the Program you must provide certain information about you.
Our collection of such information, your rights with respect to such collection,
and other relevant information is described in the Celestia Privacy Policy available
at <a href="https://celestia.org/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celestia Privacy Policy</a>, and is supplemented by
Section 3 of these Terms.</p><p>The Program is a discretionary Service provided by the Company, pursuant to which
the Company may, in its sole discretion, provide you ITN Rewards for your successful
completion of certain tasks on a Testnet designated by the Company. Please note that
any such Testnet itself (as well as any other Testnets or any mainnet deployment of
the Celestia Protocol) is not a Service and does not constitute an element of the
Services. We do not control the Celestia Protocol and accept no liability for its
operation or its deployment in any testnet or mainnet environment.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-general-terms">1. General Terms<a href="#1-general-terms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. General Terms" title="Direct link to 1. General Terms">​</a></h2><p><strong>1.1</strong> You must be eighteen (18) years of age or older and capable of forming a
binding contract with the Company in order to participate in the Program
or receive ITN Rewards.</p><p><strong>1.2</strong> You agree and acknowledge that you (a) may receive ITN Rewards for free
(other than applicable taxes, if any) from your participation in the Program,
(b) were not previously promised ITN Rewards, unless pursuant to a separate
written agreement, and (c) took no action in anticipation of or in reliance
on receiving any ITN Rewards, unless pursuant to a separate written agreement.</p><p><strong>1.3</strong> Your eligibility to participate in or receive ITN Rewards from the Program
is subject to our sole discretion. The complete list of actions you must complete
to earn ITN Rewards may not have been described in the documentation released by
us from time to time, you may not receive ITN Rewards even if you successfully
complete such actions, and no documentation related to the Program entitles you
to any ITN Rewards or to participate in the Program.</p><p><strong>1.4</strong> You agree and acknowledge that (a) you are not a Prohibited Person, (b) you
are not a U.S. Person as defined in Rule 902(k) of Regulation S under the U.S.

use a VPN or other tool to circumvent any geoblock or other restrictions that
we may have implemented for participants in the Program, and (d) you are not
participating in, and have not become eligible to participate in, the Program
by receiving credentials from any other person or entity. Any circumvention or
violation of the above will permanently disqualify you from participation in the Program.</p><p><strong>1.5</strong> You agree and acknowledge that if you are unable to claim ITN Rewards due to
technical bugs, gas fees, loss of access to a Wallet or the keys thereto, or
for any other reason, you will have no recourse or claim against us or any other
Company Entity and that neither we nor any other Company Entity will bear any liability.</p><p><strong>1.6</strong> You agree and acknowledge that claiming an ITN Reward may require reliance
on or an integration with third party products (e.g., a Wallet or an unaffiliated
network or blockchain) that we do not control. In the event that you are unable to
access such products or integrations, or if they fail for any reason, and you are
unable to participate in the Program or claim ITN Rewards, you will have no recourse
or claim against us or any other Company Entity and neither we nor any other Company
Entity will bear any liability.</p><p><strong>1.7</strong> The Company may share identifying information and documentation with certain vendors
or third-party providers who provide such identity verification and sanctions and watchlist
screening services (the <strong>&quot;Third-Party Services&quot;</strong>). You agree that your access and use of
such Third-Party Services is governed solely by the terms and conditions of such Third-Party
Services, and the Company is not responsible or liable for, and make no representations
as to any aspect of such Third-Party Services, including, without limitation, their content
or the manner in which they handle, protect, manage or process data or any interaction
between you and the provider of such Third-Party Services. You irrevocably waive any claim
against the Company with respect to such Third-Party Services. We are not liable for any damage
or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with your enablement, access or
use of any such Third-Party Services, or your reliance on the privacy practices, data
security processes or other policies of such Third-Party Services.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-taxes">2.

your participation, or that you have had the opportunity to obtain tax advice but have
chosen not to do so, (b) the Company has not provided you with any tax advice with respect
to your participation, and (c) you are not relying on the Company for any tax advice.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-supplemental-privacy-information">3.

the risks thereof. You hereby affirm that you have not relied on any representations or warranties
made by the Company related to the Program, including, but not limited to, conversations of any kind,
whether through oral or electronic communication, or any white paper.</p><p><strong>4.3</strong> <u>Compliance with United States Securities Laws</u>. You understand that the ITN Rewards
have not been, and will not be, registered under the 1933 Act or any applicable state
securities laws. You acknowledge that the availability of an exemption from the registration
provisions of the Securities Act and other applicable state securities laws depends upon,
among other things, the bona fide nature of your intent as described in Section 4.1 above
and with respect to the accuracy of your representations as expressed throughout these Terms.
You understand that the ITN Rewards may be deemed &quot;restricted securities&quot; under applicable
United States federal and state securities laws and that, pursuant to these laws, you may be
restricted from transferring any ITN Rewards unless they are registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from such registration
and qualification requirements is available. You acknowledge that the Company does not undertake
any obligation to register or qualify the ITN Rewards for resale, and exemptions from registration
and qualification may not be available or may not permit you to transfer all or any of the ITN Rewards
in the amounts or at the times proposed by you. You further acknowledge that if an
exemption from registration or qualification is available, such exemption may be
conditioned on various requirements including, but not limited to, the time and manner
of sale, the holding period for the ITN Rewards, and on other factors outside of your
control, for which the Company makes no assurances and may not be able to satisfy.</p><p><strong>4.4</strong> <u>Compliance with Liechtenstein Security Law</u>. You understand that nothing in these
Terms will be deemed to constitute a prospectus of any sort in Liechtenstein or in
any jurisdiction in the EU; nor does it in any way pertain to a public offering or
a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in Liechtenstein or in any
jurisdiction in the EU.</p><p><strong>4.5</strong> <u>No Public Market</u>. You understand that no public market now exists for the
ITN Rewards, and that the Company has not made any assurances that a public
market will ever exist for the ITN Rewards.</p><p><strong>4.6</strong> <u>No Solicitation</u>. At no time were you presented with or solicited by any publicly
issued or circulated newspaper, mail, radio, television or other form of general
advertising or solicitation in connection with any invitation to participate in
the Program or offer of the ITN Rewards.</p><p><strong>4.7</strong> <u>Other Applicable Laws</u>. You hereby represent that you have satisfied yourself
as to the full observance of the laws of your jurisdiction in connection with
any invitation to participate in the Program, receipt of ITN Awards, and other
use of these Terms, including (a) the legal requirements within your jurisdiction
for participating in the Program and receiving ITN Rewards, (b) any foreign exchange
restrictions applicable to such participation or receipt, (c) any governmental or
other consents that may need to be obtained, and (d) the income tax and other tax
consequences, if any, that may be relevant to the receipt, holding, sale, or transfer
of the ITN Rewards. Your participation in the Program and continued beneficial
ownership of ITN Rewards will not violate any applicable securities or other
laws of your jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>4.8</strong> <u>Non-US Transaction</u>. You are not a U.S. Person as defined in Rule 902(k)
of Regulation S under the 1933 Act. The offer of the ITN Rewards to you was
made in an offshore transaction (as defined in Rule 902(h) of Regulation S),
no directed selling efforts (as defined in Rule 902(c) of Regulation S) were
made in the United States, and you are not obtaining the ITN Rewards for the
account or benefit of any U.S. Person.</p><p><strong>4.9</strong> <u>Transfer Restrictions</u>. You will not, during the Restricted Period
(as defined below) offer or sell any of the ITN Rewards (or create or maintain
any derivative position equivalent thereto) in the United States, to or for
the account or benefit of a U.S. Person or other than in accordance with
Regulation S. The Company reserves the right to impose additional transfer
restrictions with respect to the ITN Rewards in its sole discretion.</p><p><strong>4.10</strong> <u>Subsequent Sales</u>. You will, after the expiration of the applicable
Restricted Period, only offer, sell, pledge or otherwise transfer the ITN Rewards
(or create or maintain any derivative position equivalent thereto) pursuant to
registration under the 1933 Act or any available exemption therefrom and,
in any case, in accordance with applicable state securities laws.</p><p><strong>4.11</strong> <u>Legends</u>. You acknowledge and agree that the ITN Rewards will be deemed
to bear the following legends: (a) any legend required by the securities
laws of any state or country to the extent such laws are applicable to the
ITN Rewards represented by the certificate so legended, and (b): the following
legend (and even without such legend the following restrictions apply):</p><p>THE ITN REWARDS HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT WITH THE UNITED STATES
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO REGISTER THEM.
THE ITN REWARDS HAVE BEEN OBTAINED TO HOLD FOR THE LONG TERM AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO,
OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION THEREFOR. PRIOR TO THE ONE YEAR

DATE&quot;</strong> AND SUCH ONE YEAR PERIOD, THE <strong>&quot;RESTRICTED PERIOD&quot;</strong>), THE ITN REWARDS MAY NOT BE
OFFERED OR SOLD (INCLUDING OPENING A SHORT POSITION IN SUCH ITN REWARDS) IN THE
UNITED STATES OR TO U.S. PERSONS AS DEFINED BY RULE 902(k) ADOPTED UNDER THE ACT,

IN THE UNITED STATES OR OTHERWISE ENGAGE(S) IN SELLING EFFORTS IN THE UNITED STATES
AND PROVIDED THAT HEDGING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THESE ITN REWARDS MAY NOT BE CONDUCTED
UNLESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT. A HOLDER OF THE ITN REWARDS WHO IS A DISTRIBUTOR,
DEALER, SUB-UNDERWRITER OR OTHER SECURITIES PROFESSIONAL, IN ADDITION, CANNOT PRIOR

REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT IS AVAILABLE.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/celestiaorg/docs/tree/main/docs/community/itn-tos.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/community/calendar/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Community calendar</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/community/translations/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Docs translations</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#1-general-terms" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">1.
